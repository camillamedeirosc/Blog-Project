    <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Camilla! I graduated in Gastronomy but I have always wanted to work in Communication. Travel and Eating great food are my hobbies. Back in 2011, I started this blog and an Youtube Channel that has grown since 2019. I have posted about my travels in Europe, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, United States and Canada. I like to post about my experiences on my trips so I can help you with tips. If you are still curious, follow me on my other social media plataforms. Also leave me a comment about my blog by using my contact form.</p>
